<h1>Overview of Variables</h1>





In Python, variables are used to hold data. You create a variable by giving it a name and assigning it a value, like a number or a word. Python figures out the type of data automatically. Variable names can have letters, numbers, and underscores but must start with a letter. You can also assign values to multiple variables at once. There are different types of data, like whole numbers, decimals, and lists. Variables can be global (used anywhere in the program) or local (used only in a specific part), making it easy to manage and use data.

This is my most proudest piece of code in this lesson. In this Python game, variables are used to keep track of important information. The variable starts at zero and counts how many questions the player answers correctly. The two variabless num1 and num2 are told to have random numbers between 1 and 20, which are used in the math questions. The operator variable randomly picks addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and the correct_answer variable calculates the right answer based on the numbers and the chosen operation. 

Overall, I think my mastery with this skill is high. I understand the concepts and I'm able to set variables and utlize them.
