<h1>Overview of Pseudocode and Lists</h1>

Pseudocode is a simplified way of representing an algorithm using plain language, making it easy to understand the logic without worrying about specific programming syntax. 

It allows you to outline the steps of a program in a structured format, focusing on the overall flow and logic rather than the exact code. This makes it a useful tool for planning and communicating ideas before actual coding begins.

Lists are a built-in data structure in Python used to store multiple items in a single variable. 
They can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, or even other lists. Lists are ordered, meaning the items have a defined sequence, and they are mutable, allowing you to change, add, or remove elements after the list is created. Lists are commonly used for organizing and managing collections of data efficiently.

<h1>Example and What I Learned</h1>

This script helps users manage a list of numbers through a simple menu. It starts by creating an empty list called numlist. A loop runs, asking the user to choose from four options: enter a number, add the numbers in the list, remove the last number added, or exit. If the user chooses to enter a number, the script checks if it’s valid. If valid, the number gets added to the list. If the user wants to add numbers, the script calculates and shows the sum of all numbers in the list. If they choose to remove a number, it takes out the last one added, but only if the list isn’t empty. Choosing to exit ends the loop and the program. If an invalid option is selected, the loop simply continues.
