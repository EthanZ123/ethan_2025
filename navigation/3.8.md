<h1>Overview of Interations</h1>

Iterations in Python allow you to run a block of code repeatedly, usually with loops. The two main types are for loops and while loops. A for loop lets you go through items in a sequence, like a list or string, performing actions on each item. A while loop keeps running as long as a specific condition is true, which is useful when you donâ€™t know how many times you need to repeat the code. Using iterations makes your code cleaner and more efficient for repetitive tasks.

The code first puts the count as zero and adds two each time. The while loop is to keep the code running as long as the number is equal to or less than twenty, but then if it isn't, the code will break
