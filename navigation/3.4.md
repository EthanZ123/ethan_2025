<h1>Overview of 3.4</h1>


JavaScript strings and Python strings are both used to represent text data, but they have some differences in the way you write them. For example, JS uses single quotes, double quotes, or backticks. In Python, strings are also defined with single and double quotes, but triple quotes are also a possible method. Strings are important in progamming for working with lots of text. They can hold anything from words to sentences and it allows you to combine text together and access characters. Strings help people find and replace text and count how many characters are in them. 

<h1>Example and what I learned</h1>

This code defines a function called remove_vowels that removes certain letters from a string. The letters it removes are "e," "t," "h," "a," and "n," in both uppercase and lowercase. The function goes through each character in the input string and keeps only those that arenâ€™t in the list of letters to remove. It then combines the remaining characters back into a single string and returns it. For example, if you use the function on the sentence "I enjoy learning Python!", it will return "I joy lrg Py!" because it removes the specified letters.
