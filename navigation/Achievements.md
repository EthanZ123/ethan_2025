<h1>How I've Grown</h1>

From the start: At the beginning of the year, I had no experience with computer science and I had a lot of trouble catching up with the rest of the class, especially after being absent for the two days out of the first week of school. 

Now: With help from my table mates and teacher, I really grew in computer science. Working together on projects allowed us to share ideas and solve problems as a team.

Our teacher provided clear guidance that helped me understand tough concepts and think critically. 
I gained a better appreciation for programming languages and problem-solving. The support from my peers created a positive environment where we celebrated our successes and learned from mistakes.

Now, I feel more confident in my skills and excited about my future in computer science!
