<h1>Overview of Conditionals</h1>

Conditionals in Python help you make decisions in your code. The main statements are if, elif, and else. An if statement checks a condition and runs a block of code if that condition is true. If it’s not true, you can use elif to check another condition. If neither condition is true, the code in the else block will run.

This code generates a random number between 0 and 1. It uses the random.random() function to do this and stores the number in random_number. Then, it checks if random_number is greater than 0.5. If it is, the code prints that the number is greater than 0.5 and shows the number. If it’s not, it prints that the number is less than or equal to 0.5, along with the number. So, it simply tells you whether the random number is above or below 0.5.
