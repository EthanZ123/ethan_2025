<h1>Overview of 3.2</h1>

Data abstraction lets you work with things and perform simple actions without needing to understand all of the mechanics on how it works. This makes it easier to work with complicated systems by allowing you to focus on what you need to rather than getting lost in the details.

The code uses abstraction by making it easy for users to perform math operations without needing to understand how the calculations work. Users simply enter two numbers and choose an operation like addition or subtraction. The program hides the details of how it performs these operations, allowing users to focus on getting their results. This makes the program simple and user-friendly, as they only interact with the basic input and output while the complex processing happens in the background.

Overall, I think my mastery for this topic is good. I fully understand the data abstraction in the above picture and I I'm able to describe it.
