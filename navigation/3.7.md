<h1>Overview of Nested Conditionals</h1>

Nested conditions are when you place one if statement inside another. This allows you to check multiple conditions in a clear and organized way. For instance, you might first check if a number is positive by seeing if it's greater than zero. If it is positive, you can then check if it’s even or odd by seeing if it can be divided by two without a remainder. If the number is even, you print that it’s positive and even; if it’s odd, you print that it’s positive and odd. If the initial condition is false, you can handle cases where the number is zero or negative separately. By using nested conditions, you can create more specific and detailed decision-making in your code.

This code asks the user for their age and whether they like sweets, then uses nested conditions to decide what snack they can have. It first collects the user's age as an integer and their preference for sweets as a lowercase string. If the user is under 18 and likes sweets, it suggests "You can have candy." If they don’t like sweets, it suggests "You can have a healthy snack." For users 18 or older, if they like sweets, it recommends a healthy snack, and if not, it offers a fruit snack. Thus, the code tailors snack options based on age and sweet preferences.
