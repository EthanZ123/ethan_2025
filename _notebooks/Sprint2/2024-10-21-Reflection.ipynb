    "Teaching 3.3 and 3.5 lessons has helped me learn the meterial involving boolean values and mathmatical expressions better because I had to really understand the material to explain it to others. When I taught, I broke down complex ideas and organized my thoughts, which deepened my comprehension. I also had to think about questions others might ask, which helped me spot any gaps in my own understanding. This process kept me actively engaged with the conent, making it more memorable. Overall, teaching is not only a reinforcement of what I know, but it also builds important skills like communication, problem-solving, and leading to a better learning experience. \n",
