However, my weaknesses are on the more broader aspects of this, as I got several question wrongs that involve specific vocabulary words that I haven't learned yet. Overall, to improve, I should know do more practice MCs to get used to their question styles and to encounter more of the vocabulary words that I do not understand. "
