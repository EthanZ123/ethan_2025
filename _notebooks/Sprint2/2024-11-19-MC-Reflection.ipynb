    "My stregth is understanding the code segments and interpreting them, as I got most of the questions that involve asking how the code functions or how to perform the code. However, my weaknesses are on the more broader aspects of this, as I got several question wrongs that involve specific vocabulary words that I haven't learned yet. Overall, to improve, I should know do more practice MCs to get used to their question styles and to encounter more of the vocabulary words that I do not understand. "
