    "AI technology: Self-driving cars \n",
    "Research: Intended use to supplement human labor. They serving as autonomous buses or shuttles to improve public transit systems as well as provide people with normal modes of transportation\n",
    "New Use: Self-driving cars can also be used as mobile delivery vehicles, providing automatic delivery. This will be instrumental in lessening the labor of the work force for online brands that often deliver their goods with real people. \n",
    "Impact: Self driving cars could be essential for people with disabilities and provide overall people with an easy method of transportation hands free. Two risks would be accidental system errors that could result in a crash. The other one comes with human morality and the concern that people will become too dependent on these technologies. "

    "Identify a Problem – A problem With AI is that there is often a displacement of jobs with people in the liberal arts field. Their jobs are often being threatened because the constant output of material can be detrimental to human ingenuity and creativity. \n",
    "Describe the Risk – This creates a problem with society because it devalues real human creativity and values cheap content over soulful artworks. Terminally, this could result in demoralizing artwork and the position of artists in this society. \n",
    "Propose Two Solutions – Companies should restrict the uses of AI when it comes to artwork. Instead of it being accessible to the majority, it should be restricted to only people with sufficient licenses. Another soltuion to AI would be to value human art work more than AI\n",
    "Write a Short Reflection (3-5 sentences) – Ethical AI development is important because it would mean that our society can coexist with AI, rather than become dominated by an AI culture. If the latter happens, our society maylack ingenuity and enough artists to express creativity. The difference between AI and humans are the aspects of originiality. If something is not done to restrict AI, and since AI cannot develop new ideas on its own, it makes human artwork ever more valuable. "

    "Amazon developed an AI-based recruiting tool to make the hiring process more efficient by analyzing resumes and recommending top candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: The AI system was found to be biased against women. It penalized resumes that included terms like \"women's chess club captain\" or any reference to women’s colleges, as it had been trained on past hiring data that reflected male dominance in technical roles.\n",

    "3. Evaluate the Response\n",
    "Amazon eventualyl scrapped the idea when they identified the bias, and recognizing it made them realize that it couldn't have fair hiring practices. \n",
