    "| Sprint 1-3 Review Ticket      | 3             |    85%       |      I would likely receive an 85% for my use of tools like VS Code and Postman because I demonstrated a solid understanding of how to utilize these tools effectively throughout the project. I was able to write and debug code in VS Code with confidence, leveraging its features to streamline my workflow and ensure the project’s functionality. Similarly, I used Postman to test APIs and troubleshoot issues, helping to validate the integration of various components. While I used both tools well overall, there were a few moments where I could have explored additional features or optimized my approach for even better efficiency. For example, I could have utilized more advanced debugging features in VS Code or taken better advantage of Postman’s automated testing capabilities. Though my work was generally effective, these small missed opportunities for optimization held me back from achieving a higher score. With a bit more attention to detail and a deeper exploration of these tools’ full capabilities, I could have further improved my contributions.        |\n",
    "| Sprint 3 Team Issue(s)/Plan   | 2             |      85%     | I feel that I did a solid job covering the main points and demonstrating a clear understanding of the overall goals. I was able to articulate the core objectives and strategy effectively, which helped set a strong foundation for the project or presentation. However, I recognize that I missed some details and opportunities for improvement that could have enhanced the overall approach. While I captured the big picture well, there were certain smaller aspects that I didn’t fully explore or emphasize, which could have added more depth or clarity. Additionally, although the organization of my work was effective, I see areas where I could refine specific sections to improve the flow and coherence of the presentation. By addressing these details and taking a more thorough approach in certain areas, I believe I could make the plan more comprehensive and impactful.    |\n",
    "| Beginning-2-End Contribution  | 2             |     85%      |     I would likely receive an 85% for my Beginning-2-End contribution because I demonstrated strong engagement throughout the process and contributed meaningfully to the overall effort. I stayed involved and committed, offering valuable input and helping to push the project forward. However, I recognize that there were certain finer details or moments where I lacked consistency, which affected the overall polish of my work. While my contributions were solid and effective, there were areas where I could have been more thorough or attentive, especially when it came to smaller elements that could have enhanced the overall quality or impact. For instance, I might have overlooked some key aspects in the planning phase or missed opportunities to refine certain sections in the execution. These gaps in detail or consistency held me back from achieving a higher score. Moving forward, I can improve by focusing more on these subtleties, ensuring a more seamless and complete contribution across all stages of the process.      |\n",
    "| N@tM Team Presentation        | 2             |     85%      |       I feel that I made a valuable contribution to the project and presented my part clearly, but looking back, there are definitely areas where I could have done more to enhance the overall outcome. While I was able to communicate my ideas effectively and ensured my segment was well-understood, I recognize that my delivery could have been smoother. There were moments when I might have conveyed my points with more confidence or clarity, which would have made the presentation more engaging and fluid. Additionally, while I actively participated in the project, I see that there were opportunities to improve coordination within our group. At times, we could have been more aligned in terms of timing, transitions, or consistency in messaging. More frequent communication or a better sense of synchronization could have helped make the entire project feel more cohesive. Overall, I demonstrated a solid understanding of the project goals and put in a good amount of effort, but I recognize that with a few adjustments—particularly in my delivery and our team coordination—I could have contributed even more effectively. There’s room for growth, and I’m committed to refining these aspects moving forward.    |\n",

I made an effort to help the team stay on track, often assisting others when needed and participating in discussions to move our project forward. However, there were areas where I could have been more proactive, such as taking the initiative to seek additional tasks or suggest improvements. Additionally, I could have been more collaborative, engaging more openly with team members and contributing additional ideas during planning sessions. While I met my core responsibilities well, there’s room to improve my communication, especially in keeping others informed of my progress and seeking feedback more regularly. Enhancing my engagement in these ways could strengthen the overall effectiveness of the team and create an even more collaborative environment.    | \n",
