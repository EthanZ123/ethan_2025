    "By implementing agile methodologies like SCRUM and Kanban, I was able to keep track of project progress and manage tasks efficiently. The Kanban boards helped me break down tasks into manageable chunks, ensuring that both frontend and backend developments moved forward smoothly. I maintained clear burndown lists, which allowed me to track iterations and issues for both the frontend and backend features. This approach helped me stay organized and focused, contributing to the successful development of the leadership application."

    "Frontend and Backend Integration: I ensured a seamless connection between the frontend and backend. On the frontend, I focused on designing an interactive and user-friendly interface, using buttons that triggered the application form’s display. This created a more engaging experience while keeping the interface uncluttered. On the backend, I implemented a Leadership model using Flask and SQLAlchemy to manage leadership applications. I also integrated dynamic data fetching from an external API, which helped maintain up-to-date information in the system. This ensured the frontend and backend worked cohesively together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improving Applications: Throughout the project, I made improvements based on previous projects and user feedback. For example, I ensured that the CSS matched the existing aesthetic of the website by refining the button styles, applying a red gradient to make them pop, and ensuring consistency across the platform. I also took extra care to make the pagination button work seamlessly, even modifying the backend model to allow this feature to function properly.\n",

    "Code Comments and Style: I made sure to adhere to coding best practicesa to maintain clean, readable, and organized code. By adding comments to my code, I was able to clarify complex logic and ensure that anyone reviewing the code could easily understand how the different pieces fit together."
